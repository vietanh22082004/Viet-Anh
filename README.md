- Timeline business: 1/1/2012 - 31/12/2015.
- The company operates in multiple markets : Asia, Africa, US, EMEA, Europe, LATAM.

## Insight 
- Profits from all markets rose consistently until 2015. The EMEA market vanished, propelling the US market to the top with a 2.5-fold increase, while the Asian market sharply halved.
- The profit margin can be observed to have steadily increased from 2012 to 2014, but experienced a sharp decline in the following year.
- Profit in the various months fluctuated quite steadily, with a consistent growth trend from April to June. However, there was a significant decline in July. A slight decrease towards the end of the year, followed by an increase at the beginning of the next year.
- Can be observed that the West Africa and West Asia regions have negative profits due to both regions having exceptionally high average discount values compared to other regions: West Africa (43.39%) and West Asia (35.28%).
- The Tables category makes good money, but it's not profitable because it has much higher discounts compared to other subcategories.
- Some issue with customer...


## Summarize

- It's important to highlight the decline in profit observed in 2015 and the recurring decrease in profit each July. The primary cause is the significant decline in profits in both the Consumer segment and the United States. We need to improve our services and organize additional events and promotional programs in July.
- Continuing to strengthen our business presence in the US market. There is a need for significant improvement in the Asian.
- Improving the discount rates in certain regions that are currently not optimal.
- Introducing customer attraction programs.
- The discount for the Tables sub-category is excessively high.
